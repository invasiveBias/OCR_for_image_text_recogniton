# OCR_for_image_text_recogniton
A Deep-Learning project to build an Optical Character Recognition model to transcribe text based images to actual text. The model combines Convolutional Neural Nets ,Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory and the Cost Temporal Classification loss function.
The project is split into 4 parts: General introduction into OCR, Data processing, Building & training the model & Evaluation.
The Project was built with the Keras (Tensorflow based) Library,notable sub-modules include Layers,Pre_processing,Backend,Callbacks. non-Keras modules include os, numpy,path.
Project was built on Jupyter notebook with a Local CPU machine. GPU/TPU machines are recommended to get better loss reduction during training
